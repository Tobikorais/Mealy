## About
This project is a capstone for the Phase 5 curriculum, demonstrating full-stack development, teamwork, and advanced technical skills.

---

## 1. **Backend and Frontend URLs Mismatch**

- **Problem:** Your frontend is likely still trying to POST to `http://localhost:5000/api/auth` (or other localhost URLs), but in production, your backend is running at a different URL (e.g., on Render, Heroku, or another server).
- **Solution:**  
  - Update your frontend to use the deployed backend URL for all API requests.
  - You can do this by using an environment variable (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`) and referencing it in your axios calls:
    ```js
    const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
    axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/auth`, { ... })
    ```
  - Set `VITE_API_URL` in your deployment environment to your backend's deployed URL.

---

## 2. **CORS Issues**

- **Problem:** If your backend is not configured to allow requests from your deployed frontend, the browser will block the request.
- **Solution:**  
  - Make sure your Flask backend uses CORS and allows your deployed frontend's domain:
    ```python
    from flask_cors import CORS
    CORS(app, origins=["https://your-frontend-domain.com"])
    ```
  - Or, for testing, use `CORS(app)` to allow all origins (not recommended for production).

---

## 3. **Backend User List**

- **Problem:** If you are using in-memory users, and your backend was restarted, only the default users exist (e.g., `admin`/`admin`). Any users you signed up locally are not present.
- **Solution:**  
  - Try logging in with the default credentials (`admin`/`admin`).
  - If you want persistent users, you need to use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) instead of in-memory storage.

---

## 4. **Check Network Requests**

- Open your browser's DevTools → Network tab.
- Try to log in.
- Check the request to `/api/auth`:
  - What is the URL? (Should be your deployed backend, not localhost)
  - What is the response? (401, CORS error, 404, etc.)

---

## 5. **Summary of What To Do**

1. **Update your frontend to use the deployed backend URL.**
2. **Make sure your backend allows CORS from your frontend's domain.**
3. **Try logging in with default credentials (`admin`/`admin`).**
4. **Check the Network tab for errors and let me know what you see.**

---

Your deployed frontend is live at [https://mealy-steel.vercel.app/](https://mealy-steel.vercel.app/), but you are experiencing login failures. This is a very common issue when deploying a full-stack app, and it almost always comes down to the frontend not talking to the correct backend URL.

---

## Here’s how to fix it:

### 1. **Update Your Frontend to Use the Deployed Backend URL**

Right now, your frontend is probably trying to POST to `http://localhost:5000/api/auth`, which will not work in production.  
You need to make sure all axios/fetch calls use your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/auth`).

**How to do this:**
- In your React code, use an environment variable for the API base URL:
  ```js
  const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
  axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/auth`, { ... })
  ```
- In your Vercel project settings, set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`).

### 2. **Make Sure Your Backend Allows CORS**

In your Flask backend, make sure you have:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, origins=["https://mealy-steel.vercel.app"])
```
Or, for testing:
```python
CORS(app)
```
But for production, specify your frontend domain for security.

### 3. **Try Logging in with Default Credentials**

If your backend uses in-memory users, only the default users exist after a restart:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

If you want persistent users, you need to use a database.

### 4. **Check the Network Tab**

- Open DevTools → Network tab.
- Try to log in.
- Check the request to `/api/auth`:
  - Is it going to your deployed backend, or to localhost?
  - What is the response? (401, CORS error, 404, etc.)

---

## Summary

- Set `VITE_API_URL` in your Vercel project to your backend’s deployed URL.
- Update your React code to use this variable for all API requests.
- Make sure your backend allows CORS from your frontend domain.
- Try logging in with the default credentials.

---

If you provide your backend’s deployed URL, I can give you the exact value to use for `VITE_API_URL` and the code to update.  
If you still have issues, let me know what you see in the Network tab after trying to log in.

---

To fix the login issue on your deployed frontend ([https://mealy-464v.vercel.app//)), follow these steps:

---

## 1. **Set the API URL in Your Frontend**

**a. Update your React code to use an environment variable for the backend URL:**

In your axios calls (e.g., in `AuthForm.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, etc.), replace:
```js
axios.post("http://localhost:5000/api/auth", { ... })
```
with:
```js
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/auth`, { ... })
```
Do this for all axios/fetch calls to your backend.

---

**b. In your Vercel project settings:**
- Go to your project on Vercel.
- Go to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
- Add a new variable:
  - **Key:** `VITE_API_URL`
  - **Value:** `https://your-backend-url.com` (replace with your actual deployed backend URL, e.g., `https://mealy-backend.onrender.com`)
- Redeploy your frontend after saving the variable.

---

## 2. **Allow CORS in Your Flask Backend**

In your `backend/app.py`, make sure you have:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, origins=["https://mealy-steel.vercel.app"])
```
Or, for testing:
```python
CORS(app)
```
Then redeploy or restart your backend.

---

## 3. **Try Logging In Again**

- Use the default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) or a user you created via signup.
- If you still get an error, open your browser’s DevTools → Network tab, and check the request to `/api/auth`:
  - Is it going to your deployed backend, or to localhost?
  - What is the response? (401, CORS error, 404, etc.)

---

## 4. **Summary Checklist**

- [ ] All axios/fetch calls use `VITE_API_URL` (not hardcoded localhost).
- [ ] `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel to your backend’s deployed URL.
- [ ] Flask backend allows CORS from your frontend domain.
- [ ] Both frontend and backend are redeployed/restarted.

---

If you provide your backend’s deployed URL, I can give you the exact value to use for `VITE_API_URL` and the code to update.  
If you still have issues, let me know what you see in the Network tab after trying to log in.

---

**Reference:**  
- (https://mealy-464v.vercel.app/)/)

Absolutely! Here’s exactly how to fix your deployed login issue step by step:

---

## 1. **Update Your React Code to Use an Environment Variable for the API URL**

**a. In every file where you use axios/fetch to call your backend (e.g., `AuthForm.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, etc.), replace:**
```js
axios.post("http://localhost:5000/api/auth", { ... })
```
**with:**
```js
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/auth`, { ... })
```
Do this for all axios/fetch calls to your backend (meals, orders, auth, etc.).

---

## 2. **Set the Environment Variable in Vercel**

- Go to your project on Vercel.
- Go to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
- Add a new variable:
  - **Key:** `VITE_API_URL`
  - **Value:** `https://your-backend-url.com` (replace with your actual deployed backend URL, e.g., `https://mealy-backend.onrender.com`)
- Save and redeploy your frontend.

---

## 3. **Update Flask CORS Settings**

In your `backend/app.py`, make sure you have:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, origins=["https://mealy-steel.vercel.app"])
```
Or, for testing:
```python
CORS(app)
```
Then redeploy or restart your backend.

---

## 4. **Redeploy Both Frontend and Backend**

- After making these changes, redeploy your backend and frontend.
- Try logging in again at [https://mealy-steel.vercel.app/]([https://mealy-464v.vercel.app/]).

---

## 5. **Test and Debug**

- Open your browser’s DevTools → Network tab.
- Try to log in.
- Make sure the request to `/api/auth` is going to your deployed backend, not localhost.
- If you still get an error, let me know what the response is (401, CORS error, 404, etc.).

---

## 6. **If You Want Me to Make the Code Changes**

If you paste your backend URL here (e.g., `https://mealy-backend.onrender.com`), I can:
- Edit your React code to use the environment variable everywhere.
- Show you exactly what to set in Vercel.

---

**Summary:**  
- Use `VITE_API_URL` in your React code for all backend calls.
- Set `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel to your backend’s deployed URL.
- Allow CORS from your frontend domain in Flask.
- Redeploy both frontend and backend.

Let me know your backend URL and I’ll give you the exact code to copy-paste!
